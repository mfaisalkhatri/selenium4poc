## End-to-End Tests for [owasp-juice-shop][juice-shop]

### Following is the Automation Test Strategy used for writing End-to-End Tests:

1. User will navigate to the website and close all the pop-up first.
2. User will click on Login link and click on `Not yet a customer link` and register himself on the website.
3. Once the Registration is successful, User will Log in with that username and password.
4. After successful Login, User will Add AppleJuice and BananaJuice to the Basket.
5. After asserting the messages for items added to basket, user will check for the count of items displayed on top
   of `Your Basket` link.
6. User will click on `Your Basket` link and check the order details and click on Checkout.
7. User will enter a new Address for Delivery and select it to process further.
8. User will continue further to Card for Payment and select the card added to make payment.
9. On the Order Summary page, user will verify all the details like Name, Address, Order details and total amount to be
   paid and place order.
10. User will re-check the details on Order confirmation page and check for `Thank You` message order confirmation and
    delivery message.

- End-to-End tests for Juice Shop Website are running on 'http://localhost:3000' inside the container in GitHub actions.
- CI/CD Pipeline has been added using GitHub Actions. Checkout the
  blog [How to setup GitHub Actions for Java with Maven project?][bloggithubactions] for detailed explanation of how to
  set up pipeline using GitHub actions.
- Checkout the blog [End to End testing using Selenium WebDriver and Java][seleniumblogmedium] to get better
  understanding of how to write end-to-end tests.

## End-to-End Tests for [LambdaTest ECommerce Playground Website][lambdatestecommerceplayground]

### Following is the automation test strategy used for writing end-to-end tests:

1. The User will navigate to the website.
2. From the Home Page of the screen, user will navigate to the Registration Page and register himself. Verification will
   be done by asserting the registration successful message.
3. User will click on the Shop by Category option on the top left and select a category for selecting the product to
   purchase.
4. From the Product Page, the user will hover on any product which he likes and select the Add to cart option. Once a
   product is added to cart, assertions will be performed to check the success message displayed.
5. On the Checkout page, user will provide the billing address details and also assertion will be made for product name
   and its respective price.
6. Once a product is checked out, the user lands on the Order Confirmation page, where product name, price and shipping
   address will be asserted and after that Order would be marked as confirmed.
7. Finally, an Order confirmation message would be verified in the tests which marks the end of the test journey.

## How to run the Tests?

### Running Juice Shop Tests on your local machine:

- Start `Juice-Shop` website locally, for doing this we will make use of `docker-compose-v3-juiceshop.yml` which is
  available in the root folder of this project.
- Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root folder of the project and run the following command:

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose-v3-juiceshop.yml up -d`

- Once the `Juice-Shop` website is up and running, we are good to run the end-to-end tests using the juice shop website.
- There are 2 ways to run the tests, those are as follows:
  ### 1. TestNG:
    - Right-Click on the `test-suite\testng-juice-shop.xml` and select `Run ...\test-suite\testng-juice-shop.xml`
  ### 2. Maven:
    - To run the tests in headless mode update the value for `headless` property variable to `true`

      `mvn clean install -Dsuite-xml=test-suite\testng-juice-shop.xml -Dheadless=true`

    - To run the tests without headless mode(to see the test running in browser) update the value for headless property
      variable to
      `false`

      `mvn clean install -Dsuite-xml=test-suite\testng-juice-shop.xml -Dheadless=false`


- Stopping the Juice Shop website running in local

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose-v3-juiceshop.yml down`

### Running Selenium Grid on local and running tests using Selenium Grid

- Start the Selenium Grid in local using the `docker-compose-v3-seleniumgrid.yml` file.
- Run the following command:
  `docker-compose -f docker-compose-v3-seleniumgrid.yml up -d`

  This will start the selenium grid which can be access using `http://localhost:4444`.

    - To run the tests on Selenium Grid using `TestNG`:

      Right click on `test-suite\testng-seleniumgrid-theinternet.xml` and
      select `Run test-suite\testng-seleniumgrid-theinternet.xml`

    - To run the tests on Selenium Grid using `Maven`:

      `mvn clean install -Dsuite-xml=test-suite\testng-seleniumgrid-theinternet.xml`

- Stopping the Selenium Grid:

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose-v3-seleniumgrid.yml down`

### Running all the tests in one go:

- Start the `Juice -Shop` website using following command:

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose-v3-juiceshop.yml up -d`

- Start `Selenium Grid` using following command:

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose-v3-seleniumgrid.yml up -d`

- Run the tests using `TestNG`:

  Right click on `test-suite\testng.xml` and select `Run test-suite\testng.xml`

- Run the tests using `Maven` in headless mode:

  `mvn clean install -Dheadless=true`

- Stopping the `Juice-Shop` website and `Selenium Grid`:

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose-v3-juiceshop.yml down --remove-orphan`

### Running LambdaTest ECommerce Playground Tests on your local machine:

- There are 2 ways to run the tests, those are as follows:

  ### 1. TestNG:
    - Right-Click on the `test-suite\testng-lambdatestecommerce.xml` and
      select `Run ...\test-suite\testng-lambdatestecommerce.xml`

  ### 2. Maven:
    - To run the tests in headless mode update the value for `headless` property variable to `true`

      `mvn clean install -Dsuite-xml=test-suite\testng-lambdatestecommerce.xml -Dheadless=true`

    - To run the tests without headless mode(to see the test running in browser) update the value for headless property
      variable to
      `false`

      `mvn clean install -Dsuite-xml=test-suite\testng-lambdatestecommerce.xml -Dheadless=false`
